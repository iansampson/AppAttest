# AppAttest

The App Attest service, which Apple introduced in iOS 14, provides a secure way of verifying that connections to your server come from legitimate instances of your app. Generating assertions and attestations in your app is [fairly straightforward](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/establishing_your_app_s_integrity), but verifying them on the server is [a little more complicated](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_server). This Swift package implements the server-side validation logic for you.

Note that this is still a young project and the API may change a little. At the moment, the library is able to validate assertions and attestations, but not receipts (which is an optional step, anyway). Iâ€™ll update the readme soon with instructions for usage. In the meantime, check out Sources/AppAttest/API.swift as well as the unit tests to get started.
